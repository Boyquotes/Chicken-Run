# Chicken-Run
Chicken Run is a game I am working on in Godot v3.5.2.

I began working on the game on Sunday, June 11, 2023 and began uploading to GitHub on June 16, 2023.

In the game, you play as a chicken and try to collect the keys as quickly as possible.

CONTROLS:
WASD or Arrow Keys to move. Joystick and jump button if you are on mobile.

CREDITS:
The Chicken character and all of its animations are made by 9eO (https://9e0.itch.io/chick-boy).

The tile set was made by Zack Alvarado on opengameart.org (https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-tilesets)

The game is currently runnable on Android and HTML.
