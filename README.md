# Chicken-Run
Chicken Run is a game I am working on in Godot v3.5.2. I began working on the game on Sunday, June 11, 2023 and began uploading to GitHub on June 16, 2023. This is my first game in Godot. I made it using GDScript.

In the game, you play as a chicken and try to collect the keys as quickly as possible. You must fight enemies and use critical thinking to get keys. The game is currently runnable on Android and HTML.

This game was originally made by @bluesiarra on GitHub.

CONTROLS:
WASD or Arrow Keys to move. Joystick and jump button if you are on mobile.

CREDITS:
The Chicken character and all of its animations are made by 9eO (https://9e0.itch.io/chick-boy).

The tile set was made by Zack Alvarado on opengameart.org (https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-tilesets)
